    This page displays each line chart onto this single page.
    I don't think this is the best way to do this, but it works for now. There are reusable functions each line chart page, but some have small differences between them and I don't know how to make them more abstract.
    This code should be revisited.

@page "/statistics/{goalTitle}"
@inject GoalDatabase goalDatabase;

<QuestionLineChart goalTitle="@goalTitle" ></QuestionLineChart>

<br />
<br />

<ActionLineChart goalTitle="@goalTitle" ></ActionLineChart>

<br />
<br />

<TimeSpentLineChart goalTitle="@goalTitle" ></TimeSpentLineChart>

<br />

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string goalTitle { get; set; }

}
